# Data Wrangling With Tidyverse

For this meetup we'll be referencing Claire Carroll's fantastic [post](https://blog.getdbt.com/modeling-subscription-revenue/) on modeling subscription revenue in DBT. We'll be converting the data transformation process from DBT to R. While it's not required, we suggest that you read the post before the meetup to get an understanding of the data used and the transformation process. Prior knowledge of DBT or SQL is not necessary.

For those that are adventurous how about you try this exercise and share your code with us? There will be time at the end of the presentation for code sharing. There are numerous ways to execute this transformation and it'll be interesting to see how different minds approach it.

The data can be found [here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/mrr-playbook). Additionally, here's an [RScript](starter.R) for getting started.
